    editor. Apache Camel uses URIs to work directly with any kind of Transport
    or messaging model such as HTTP, ActiveMQ, JMS, JBI, SCA, MINA or CXF, as
    well as pluggable Components and Data Format options. Apache Camel is a
    small library with minimal dependencies for easy embedding in any Java
    application. Apache Camel lets you work with the same API regardless which
    kind of Transport is used - so learn the API once and you can interact with
    all the Components provided out-of-box. Apache Camel provides support for
    Bean Binding and seamless integration with popular frameworks such as
    Spring, Blueprint and Guice. Camel also has extensive support for unit

    AWS Step Functions makes it easy to coordinate the components of distributed
    applications and microservices using visual workflows. Building applications
    from individual components that each perform a discrete function lets you
    scale and change applications quickly. Step Functions is a reliable way to
    coordinate components and step through the functions of your application.
    Step Functions provides a graphical console to arrange and visualize the
    components of your application as a series of steps. This makes it simple to
    build and run multi-step applications. Step Functions automatically triggers
    and tracks each step, and retries when there are errors, so your application
    executes in order and as expected. Step Functions logs the state of each
    step, so when things do go wrong, you can diagnose and debug problems
    quickly. You can change and add steps without even writing code, so you can
    easily evolve your application and innovate faster.  AWS Step Functions
    manages the operations and underlying infrastructure for you to help ensure
    your application is available at any scale.
