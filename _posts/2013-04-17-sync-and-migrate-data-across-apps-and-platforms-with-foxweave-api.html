<p>FoxWeave, data migration and synchronization platform, allows developers to provide FoxWeave functionality in third party apps via the FoxWeave API.FoxWeave syncs beyond cloud storage providers.Rather, FoxWeave syncs data from apps, databases, on-premise storage, cloud storage, email accounts, and more.The FoxWeave API enables developers to decide where the best single point of synchronization makes sense for an individual or business entity.Cloud computing has added ubiquity to compute and data storage; however, cloud computing has also increased the difficulty in managing data that sits across multiple networks in different forms.</p>
