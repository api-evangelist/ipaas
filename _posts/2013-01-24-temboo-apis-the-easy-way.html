<p>What we love about being a software developer today: access to most services and data is free.The sky’s the limit!But what we really don’t love is that all those free APIs work in frustratingly different ways, and it’s those differences that stop our app dreams from becoming realities.The Problem With APIs

It’s headache-inducing for developers to figure out how to authenticate, make calls, parse responses and manage credentials every time we want to try a new API.We know companies make lots of decisions when they open up their platform and data to the world, and those choices about protocols, formats, authentication, etc.</p>
