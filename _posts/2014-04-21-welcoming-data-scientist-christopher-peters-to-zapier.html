<p>A note from Wade Foster, Zapier CEO: Finding new teammates for an early stage startup is tough.Its about identifying just the right mix of skill and culture fit.This has never been more evident than with our latest hire to fill a new data position.After interviewing 50-plus people with backgrounds in statistics, data science and data engineering, Chris Peters stood head and shoulders above the rest.What will a data scientist do at Zapier?</p>
