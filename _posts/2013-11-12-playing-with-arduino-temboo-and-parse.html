<p>This is a guest post from Leon Barrett of 383, a creative agency in the UK.You can check out their website, and access the original post, here.We’ve been working with some open source electronics kit called Arduino for quite a while now and have recently been playing with one of the latest Arduino boards – the Yún.We’ve fallen in love with Arduino at 383 as it allows us to quickly and cheaply create physical interactive projects – one of which is Brian, the social pigeon (you can read more about Brian and see him here)!The Arduino is a development board which has an integrated chip which allows blocks of code, or ‘sketches’ to be uploaded via USB.</p>
