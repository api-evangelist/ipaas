<p>Zapier is a web application which allows you to create custom integrations, or ‘zaps’, between other web applications.Zapier supports Flowdock as a target for an integration.Check out the list of tools you can integrate with Flowdock using Zapier.Example: Get Notifications From Asana To Flowdock
  Integrating services with Asana is a bit more work than the average Flowdock integration, but it can be well worth it.As an extra, you get plenty of filtering features that are implemented in Zapier.</p>
