<p>In the proprietary software world, the beta program is the only way to get insight into what’s coming in the next release.Sure, roadmap presentations under NDA with the Chief Architect also give a good idea – but the truth is, one doesn’t know how it works until they can actually kick the tires.Open source is different.The development process is open, and progress on features is visible to anyone who cares to follow the project tracker.And since builds are produced on a regular basis, anyone can download the latest milestone release and try out the new features, pretty much before everyone.</p>
