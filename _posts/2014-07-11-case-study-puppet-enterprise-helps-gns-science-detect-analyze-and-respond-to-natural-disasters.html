<p>New Zealand is a hotspot for natural disasters, and with a sparse, widely distributed population, delivering timely information about natural disasters is a real challenge.That’s why the South Pacific island nation’s Earthquake Commission funded GeoNet, a hazard monitoring system built and operated by GNS Science, New Zealand’s leading provider of earth science, geoscience and isotope research and consulting services.For most traditional IT shops, a large earthquake is something to prepare for, but probably not worry about too much.GeoNet’s core purpose is to stay up and running at a high performance level during such an event, so Geo Science’s IT operations have to be unusually resilient — especially for an organization of its size and resource levels.With uptime and consistency so important to its operations, GNS Science decided to standardize its configuration management on Puppet Enterprise.</p>
