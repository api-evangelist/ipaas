<p>EAT is a food supplier that specializes in “fresh and uncomplicated” sandwiches, soups, pies, and salads; every day, it distributes its freshly prepared breakfast and lunch foods to over a hundred locations throughout the U.K.One of EAT’s primary concerns is optimizing its use of data to control quality and ensure loss prevention—the short shelf life of its products and its commitment to freshness, makes precision in production absolutely essential.The data needed to make sure that everything gets to where it needs to be when it needs to be there, however, is not as straightforward to gather as one might think—warehouse supply levels, store locations, employee schedules, sales patterns, and even weather reports must be considered when planning an efficient strategy.These data points come from different sources and in different formats, creating discrepancies which can cause shortages or waste.</p>
