<p>Control an Arduino Yún with Your Phone: Using Temboo & the Nexmo API                             
Ever wish you could use your phone to control your Arduino Yún?We’ve just come up with a really cool way to do it without using a smartphone app or even sending a text message.Instead, your Yún calls you and lets you control it just by typing in a number on your keypad.Check out this video demo to see this in action.What’s happening here is that whenever the photocell detects a significant change in light, the Arduino Yún calls a Choreo for the Nexmo API, which calls your phone with a voice message.</p>
