<p>Since our beginnings as an operating system, Jolicloud has worked passionately to make the digital world simpler to use for everyone.As we spent our days switching between our phones and computers, juggling between multiple services and seeing our data spread across the Internet, we believed something was missing in our lives.A place to call home.A place where everything that belongs to you is always there.A place that makes all your content simple to access and use.</p>
