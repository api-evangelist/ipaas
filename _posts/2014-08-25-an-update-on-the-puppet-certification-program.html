<p>We have recently decided to retire the Puppet Developer certification exam, effective Sept.30, 2014.This exam, which focuses on developing for Puppet using Ruby, is approaching the end of its second year, and in evaluating the demand for this type of certification, we’ve found there isn’t enough interest within the Puppet community to warrant an update.If you currently hold a Puppet Developer certification, it will not expire.However, as we continue to release newer versions of Puppet, your credential will be further out of sync with each version.</p>
