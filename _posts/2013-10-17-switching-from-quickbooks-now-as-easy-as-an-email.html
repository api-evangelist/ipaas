<p>A month ago in Chicago I was fortunate to attend a cloud conference for a future add-on.As the representatives demonstrated how to move the data from QuickBooks into their solution, it was clear how painful it was – multiple steps, saving of files, finding files, backup required, and validation of the integrity of the systems after importing the data.In contrast, when they demoed the integration (in beta) with Xero, it was simple, smooth and – well – worked as expected.Night and day difference.As a follow-up, I took the stage, talked about Xero and fielded questions from the crowd.</p>
