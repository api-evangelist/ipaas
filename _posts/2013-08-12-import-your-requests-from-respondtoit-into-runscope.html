<p>Of the many webhook debugging tools out there, respondto.it was among the first to support custom responses.Built by Aaron Lerch and launched in early 2012, respondto.it lets you create an endpoint that returns XML or JSON and displays a list of recent requests.  If youre testing out a service like Twilio, this can be invaluable for quickly prototyping an idea, or even writing a simple app.</p>
