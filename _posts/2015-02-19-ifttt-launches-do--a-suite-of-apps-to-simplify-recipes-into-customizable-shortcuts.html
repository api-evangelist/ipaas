<p>Many of us in the tech community love IFTTT (If This, Then That), an automation algorithm that connects two or more internet-connected tools like a falling domino chain.Since its launch in 2011, IFTTT has expanded widely in the consumer market, with integrations on many popular gadgets from Fitbit, HP printers to Hue lightbulbs and Smappee home energy monitor.Despite the myriad of IFTTT-integrated devices, however, barrier to entry is often limited to the amateur techie who doesn’t mind sifting through IFTTT channels to set up recipes for their Web tools.To give users more creative control and ease of use, the company today launched Do, a new suite of apps that should make recipe setups as simple as a touch of a button.The Do apps – Do Button, Do Camera, Do Note – are designed to simplify the process by letting users drag and drop tools they want to connect and customize recipes through a minimalistic UX.</p>
