<p>Here at CloverETL we not only work to create new and exciting features, but also have a workgroup specifically dedicated to improving the “little things”.I’m talking about those little things that can help you avoid aimlessly clicking around while trying to do work, or make you think in a quick, intuitive, and productive manner.Listed below are some of the most important tweaks and improvements that CloverETL 3.4 can provide.We think you will find them useful in that they will make working with the CloverETL Designer not only more comfortable, but also more effective.</p>
