<p>Chandra Krintz is the CTO of AppScale Systems, an open source, cloud platform that mirrors all of the Google App Engines APIs.You can use AppScale to run any Google App Engine application on your own private cloud infrastructure.Since, according to Krintz, APIs arent protected by copyright, companies like AppScale are free to reverse engineer the internal functionality of Googles App Engine.They dont have complete visibility into how features are implemented, but they can test their service by running a variety of different applications to see if it produces the same results.AppScale is also a Google Cloud Platform technology partner, so get some insight into future changes.</p>
