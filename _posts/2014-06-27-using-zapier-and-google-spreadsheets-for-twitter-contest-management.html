<p>Over the past few weeks, we’ve been giving away Fitbit Flex wristbands through a contest we’re running on Twitter.When we were initially planning how we want to run it, we knew that it had to be something that was as automated as possible and needed to be fair for everyone involved.It also seemed like this contest is simple enough that we shouldn’t need to pay a service or someone to manage it.I’ve become a huge fan of Zapier over the past few months.I use it to automate quite a few tasks that would otherwise cost me time every day, week, or month.</p>
