<p>At the Gartner Application Architecture, Development & Integration Summit (#GartnerAADI) in London, Talend made a second announcement related to version 5.3 (the first announcement essentially addressed big data news, around the Data, Big and Easy theme).  This announcement discusses new capabilities of the data services platform, and the extension of support for complex and semi-structured data sets.I know I am probably opening a can of worms here, but I consider there are three broad categorizations of data when it relates to structuration:
  Structured data is typically of the “schema-on-write” category.  In other words, when inserting/creating records or data sets, the schema or structure of this data is well defined and must be adhered to – whether by technical obligation or not.</p>
