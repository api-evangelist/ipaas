<p>Data Quality follows the same principles than other well defined quality related processes: it is all about engaging an improvement cycle to Define & detect, Measure, Analyze, Improve and Control quality.This doesnâ€™t happen at one time, or one place.It should be an ongoing effort, and that is often neglected when dealing with data quality.Think about the big ERP, CRM or IT consolidation projects where data quality gets high attention during the roll out, and then fades away once the project is delivered.The ubiquitous nature of quality is key, as well.</p>
