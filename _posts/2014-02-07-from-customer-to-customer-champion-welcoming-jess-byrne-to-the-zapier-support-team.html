<p>A Note from Wade: Since day one at Zapier, providing excellent support for all users, including those who use the product for free, has been a top priority.In fact, our very first hire, Micah Bennett, came on to help with support.As our userbase and subsequently support load grew, it became obvious our support team must grow, too.And thats when I met Jess Byrne, who not only has experience in customer support roles with multiple great tech companies but is an avid Zapier user, too.Im downright giddy to have her join us and help make Zapier customers some of the happiest around.</p>
