<p>Heartbleed, a major vulnerability in the technology that powers encryption across much of the internet was discovered on April 7th. Like many other companies, we took swift action to make sure we were not affected and patched any existing vulnerabilities.Otixo is no longer vulnerable to Heartbleed.We updated our primary servers immediately on Tuesday and finally our certificates on Thursday.We have no evidence of any breach or misuse by an outsider.</p>
