<p>Mitch Sonies is the founder and CEO of Cloudsmith, the developer of Stack Hammer, a Puppet-based SaaS application for creating and deploying software stacks to the cloud, and Geppetto, an IDE for Puppet module developers.It’s official: Puppet Labs and Cloudsmith are now one company.(Actually, this has been true for a month, but “official” news sometimes travels a bit more slowly!) Speaking for those of us on the Cloudsmith side, the transition was frictionless, the first month has been great and we’re thrilled to be part of the team.The easiest way to explain how much sense this makes is to look back at the last two years and see how we got here.</p>
