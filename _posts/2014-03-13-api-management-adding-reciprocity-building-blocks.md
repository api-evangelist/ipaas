<p>Iâ€™m adding a new grouping to my list of API management building blocks, called reciprocity.If you want to know what I mean by reciprocity check out my earlier post From ETL to API Reciprocity, Looking at 20 Service Providers.As I was working with Nimble the CRM system last night, and I was planning out some workflows associated with keeping contact data up to date, and noticed that Nimble provides access to Zapier automation tools directly from their interface, using an iframe.Providing access to API automation tools for your developers, and end-users, is an important piece of a larger reciprocity puzzle.As an API provider you should allow for developers and end-users to access, migrate, download, and orchestrate the flow of their own data.</p>
