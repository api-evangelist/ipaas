<p>In the latest Puppet Labs Podcast, Dawn Foster is joined by Henrik Lindberg and Kenn Hussey to tell you about Geppetto, a Puppet IDE (Integrated Development Environment).Geppetto validates your code, checking for problematic expressions and  telling you no, youre going to regret doing that!Its configurable - so you can control how much of a nagging, backseat driver you want Geppetto to be, by saying either Ignore all stylistic problems, Ill do it my way!, or Turn them into warnings or errors
 Geppetto gives you a whole gift basket of goodness, with syntax highlighting, code completion, and the ability to navigate the source code in a smart way, full integration with the Puppet Forge, and.well, Ill stop with the spoilers and let you listen to Henrik and Kenn tell you about it themselves!</p>
