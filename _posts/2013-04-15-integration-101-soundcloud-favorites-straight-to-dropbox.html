<p>Integration 101 is an ongoing series where I’ll describe some of the useful workflows that can be created with the Bipio API in a few easy steps.A basic understanding of RESTful API’s and SaaS is assumed, and if you have experience with graphs and graph traversals that’s helpful too but not necessary.If there’s anything you’d like to see, let me know.Otherwise it’s onward and upward with some crazy experiments!I’m a lazy (busy?</p>
