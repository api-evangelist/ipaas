<p>Many who live in large cities carry a contactless public transportation pass in their wallet (Oyster in London, Navigo in Paris, Octopus in Hong Kong…), which primary use is to authorize access of its bearer through the turnstiles of the metro or onboard a bus, and to charge this bearer for the journey.I say primary use, but that’s really the only use that the travelling public sees of the card.Still, records subpoenaed from the transportation authority have in some cases been produced in court to prove (or disprove) the presence of an individual at a certain location at a certain time.Conspiracy theorists will probably argue that the NSA is anyway tracking all moves of bearers of such cards – after all, it’s only another database to gain access to, and more big data volumes to track… 
Transportation contactless cards are not only used to commute to work.For some years, they have also been adopted by ski resorts to replace lift tickets.</p>
