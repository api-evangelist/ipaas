<p>If This Then That (IFTTT) is a great website to automate simple recurring processes.Through IFTTT.com you can set up triggers that cause actions to automatically happen.For example, you can automatically tweet a picture you posted on Instagram, or get an email every time a product you are looking for on Ebay is posted.With its nearly 160 integrations, I would guess that any entrepreneur could find a use for an IFTTT recipe.</p>
