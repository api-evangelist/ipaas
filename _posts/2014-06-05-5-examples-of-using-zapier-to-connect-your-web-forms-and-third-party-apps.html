<p>Supposingly you’re watching us for a while already and employ our web forms for your great business, you probably know one thing: we exist to make your work easier.For this, we strive to offer you all sorts of integrations with third party apps, so that you can link your forms to them.Once the connection has been made, you can sit back and relax while our integrations do the dirty job for you.Even if our list of third party integrations is very broad and comprises a lot of major names like Salesforce, PayPal, MailChimp, HootSuite and many others, we don’t pretend to have all possible apps integrated with our service.But hold tight, we have a solution for these cases too.</p>
