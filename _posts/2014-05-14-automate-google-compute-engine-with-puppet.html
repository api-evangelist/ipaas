<p>At Puppet Labs, were all about enabling people to enact change quickly, predictably and consistently.Its at the core of everything we do, and one of the reasons we moved the Forge to Google Compute Engine.Google Compute Engine immediately halved Forge response time on comparable instances, and offers a lot of flexibility for how we deploy and manage our instances.We know many Puppet users are also looking for flexibility and speed, coupled with predictability.So as of Puppet Enterprise 3.</p>
