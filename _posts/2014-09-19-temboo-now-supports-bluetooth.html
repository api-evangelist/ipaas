<p>We’re very excited to introduce Bluetooth support for all the Choreos in our Library, just in time for Maker Faire New York!We’ve added the RedBearLab Bluetooth Low Energy Shield for Arduino to our connectivity options in IoT Mode, so now you can generate code for IoT mobile apps that can call any Temboo Choreo in response to a trigger from a Bluetooth-enabled Arduino board.For example, if your Android or iOS phone comes within range of your BLE shield, it can react by Tweeting, sending an email, logging data to a spreadsheet, and more!Bluetooth joins Ethernet, GSM, and WiFi in the family of networking technologies that Temboo supports.We can’t wait to see what you build with Bluetooth—email hey@temboo.</p>
