<p>Im proud to announce the release of Puppet Enterprise 3.0.As previously, you can download it now and use it for free on up to 10 nodes.This is a major release for us, and it reflects the ways in which the cloud has continued to change the constraints on infrastructure and increase the opportunity for operations to be a differentiator. The cloud promises greater agility, shorter cycle times, more flexibility and massive scale, but only if we continue to enhance automation’s ability to keep you at the front of the envelope.</p>
