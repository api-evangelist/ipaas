<p>IBM announced this morning that it has acquired UrbanCode, a software delivery automation company based in Cleveland, Ohio.The purchase price was not disclosed.The acquisition ticks all the boxes for Big Blue:Â mobile, social, big data, cloud.But the biggest value of all is in the companys ability to target software development bottlenecks and accelerate time-to-market for businesses, from months to minutes, the company proudly claims.Fail fast, as the talking heads in Silicon Valley often shout.</p>
