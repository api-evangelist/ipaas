Founded in 2002, CloverETL was the first open source ETL/Data Integration project back when Open Source was a hot topic.At that time, the Open Source was not about marketing strategy to disrupt markets and bring in money.It was about the enthusiasm of developers trying to come up with better (and cheaper) solutions to problems.To allow software technology to be accessible to everyone.It was a whole new philosophy.</p>
