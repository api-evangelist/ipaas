<p>Today, an emerging trend to expose functionalities through publicly available APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) has not only redefined how software and services are delivered, but also indicates how business value is moving towards a thriving high-paced mobile application ecosystem.Along these lines, the OPENi focal research contribution lies on the cloudlet concept and on an open API framework that will be capable of interoperating with any cloud-based service, abstracting the integration challenges to a single open standard without losing any service features.During the first months of the OPENi project, we docused on an analysis of the underlying state of the art in the cloud-based services landscape in order to provide concrete recommendations and guidelines to drive the forthcoming design and implementation of the OPENi APIs Framework.Creating a classification of the cloud-based services’ territory was not a trivial task and could have gone a long way if a concrete methodology was not applied from beginning to end.Through a well-defined approach based on the hints provided in developers’ portals (i.</p>
