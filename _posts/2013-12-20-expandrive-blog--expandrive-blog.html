<p>Jeff Mancuso             December 9th, 2013                           ExpanDrive build 3030 is out now adding GUI support for selecting a custom SSH key on the Mac.Keys in ~/.ssh are still automatically picked up, but this helps if you have a connection that uses a different key for some reason.This build also fixes a few issues with FTP on Windows as well as prompting for input on Windows.</p>
