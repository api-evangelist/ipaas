<p>A note from Wade: back in November Zapier got a face lift and some serious UX improvements.If youve enjoyed the new superhero motif and a better designed experience on Zapier, then I have some great news for you.The brainchild behind all these improvements, Bryan Landers, is joining Zapier full time.Ive known Bryan for two years now and Ive never worked with a designer/developer who is more meticulous than him.He sweats details that most people would miss.</p>
