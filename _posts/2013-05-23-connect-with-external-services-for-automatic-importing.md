{% include JB/setup %}<p>Our external imports (to services like Salesforce, Wufoo, and Capsule) has always been a manual, one-time import.This is fine is you just start using our service and would like to bring in everyone from another service.The problem is that every time you update someone in the external service, that change would not come across to ActiveCampaign until you re-imported.This became a redundant task which reduced the effectiveness of the feature.So we spent some time updating the import section to allow for automated imports from external services.</p>
