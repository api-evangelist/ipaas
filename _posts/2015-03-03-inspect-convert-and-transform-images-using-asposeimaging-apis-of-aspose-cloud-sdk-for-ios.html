<p>Aspose.Imaging for Cloud lets you use a REST API to inspect, convert, and transform images in the cloud.It supports the most popular image formats such as PSD, PNG, GIF, BMP, TIFF, and JPEG, and conversion between them.It also provides a rich set of features for manipulating images on-the-fly with cloud based image transformations.You can resize, crop and/or rotate images various ways by simply creating a request that includes the correct transformation instructions.</p>
