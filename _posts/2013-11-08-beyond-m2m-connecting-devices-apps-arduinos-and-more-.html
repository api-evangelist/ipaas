With Temboo it’s easy to set up a connected network of devices thanks to our Amazon SQS Choreos.Using this Simple Queue Service you can create mobile apps to send commands to an Arduino Yún, build your own dashboard on a computer to monitor a network of devices, and scale up as necessary with the simple, robust communication that SQS provides.Getting Arduinos to talk to each other privately or send and receive data according to your demands is easier than ever.Get started by checking out our newest Arduino tutorial that explains how to get set up with Amazon SQS.
