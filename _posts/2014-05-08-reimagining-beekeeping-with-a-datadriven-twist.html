<p>Reimagining Beekeeping with a Data-Driven Twist                             
When we say that Temboo is a tool for building the Internet of Everything, we really mean everything—we’ve seen members of the Temboo community connect all sorts of sensors, noisemakers, lights, apps, and services to one another to create something new using our library.  Now, thanks to the work being done by a student group at Yale University, we can add a few thousand bees to our list of Temboo-connected objects.  Yale Bee Space is a group of undergraduate apiarists who are designing smart beehives that they think will fundamentally change the way that bees are kept, and maybe avert ecological disaster in the process.Glen Meyerowitz, one of the founders of the group, explained to us that honeybee populations in the United States have been collapsing without explanation, and that although a number of theories exist regarding why this might be happening, there is very little data available to shed light on the problem.  Since bees play a major role in pollinating plants, collapsing colonies are causing environmental problems that go beyond just honey shortages.</p>
