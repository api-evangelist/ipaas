<p>On April 7th, a group of security researchers discovered and publicly disclosed a vulnerability called “Heartbleed” in OpenSSL library.This library is used to secure online communications for most services on the Internet.As soon as we were aware of Heartbleed, we checked our entire backend to make sure your data are and have been safe.And the good news is that we were not affected by the issue because our version of OpenSSL is not vulnerable to Heartbleed!Of course, we are still monitoring the situation and will do the necessary for you if we discover anything.</p>
