<p>Gartner defines Operational Technology (OT) as hardware and software that detects or causes a change through the direct monitoring and/or control of physical devices, processes and events [in the enterprise].In other words, OT is the computers (and their software) that exist outside of the IT world.Take a thermostat for example.It is used to regulate the temperature in a home or office building.Now, think beyond a dumb, thermocouple or mercury thermostat, and consider a cool, modern thermostat that looks and works like a phone app.</p>
