<p>I am a programmer with a full understanding of how to deploy, consume and put APIs to use.Even with this knowledge and ability Im continually blown away by the opportunities APIs afford, even without possessing any programming skills whatsoever.One API I depend on for my daily monitoring of the API space is the Pinboard API.As I browse the web, using the Pinboard bookmarklet I can pin any web page for use later, then using the Pinboard API I pull these curated pages into my monitoring, reporting and story development platform.To take this feature one step further, when I star a Tweet on Twitter, Pinboard watches this and automatically bookmarks the Tweet, adding it to my curation as well.</p>
