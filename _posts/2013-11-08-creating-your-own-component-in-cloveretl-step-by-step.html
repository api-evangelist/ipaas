<p>CloverETL is designed to be an extensible system.Although it already contains a lot of components, there can be cases where you need to create your own – be it a specific and often-used task, use of an external library, your own connector, etc.The full guide for creating a custom component is described in the documentation, but for those of you who want a quick look at the process without the lengthy details, I’ve prepared some brief instructions.If you follow this guide step by step, you’ll be able to create custom components in no time.Let’s create a component called “HelloWorld” that works just like SimpleCopy, but additionally adds a “Hello” message to every string field.</p>
