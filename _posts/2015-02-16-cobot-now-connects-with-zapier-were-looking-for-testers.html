<p>Cobot now connects with Zapier!We’re looking for testers…
We believe that openness is an important of making a larger impact, which is why we have provided a free programming interface (API) to Cobot’s since the beginning.But for less technically-inclined people, it’s often not that easy to get all the details at a glance.This was the motivation to make it much more accessible for everyone with the help of Zapier.We would love to get your feedback on this, so please use this link to try our beta!</p>
