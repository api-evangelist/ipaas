<p>In my last posting, I argued that federal agencies should consider microservices architecture when releasing APIs.This is because allowing users to combine single-purpose apps together in unique ways helps people build personalized apps such as a driving map to local farmers markets.When given the opportunity, users will surprise you with the innovative creations they build from combining APIs.Just last week, the popular If This Then That (IFTTT) service released a federal-friendly Terms of Service.This means that federal agencies can now use IFTTT to combine APIs without programming.</p>
