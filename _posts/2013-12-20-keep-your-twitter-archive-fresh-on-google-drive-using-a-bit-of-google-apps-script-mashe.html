<p>Like a growing number of other people I’ve requested and got a complete archive of my tweets from Twitter … well almost complete.The issue is that while Twitter have done a great job of packaging the archives even going as far as creating a search interface powered by HTML and JavaScript as soon as you’ve requested the data it is stale.The other issue is unless you have some webhosting where can you share your archive to give other people access.Fortunately as Google recently announced site publishing on Google Drive by uploading your Twitter archive to a folder and then sharing the folder so that it’s ‘Public on the web’ you can let other people explore your archive (here’s mine).Note: Mark Sample (@samplereality) has discovered that if you have file conversion on during upload this will break your archive.</p>
