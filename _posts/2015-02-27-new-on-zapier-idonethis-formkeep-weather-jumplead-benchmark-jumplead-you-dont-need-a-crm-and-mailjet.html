<p>Though February is the shortest month of the year, it didnt stop us from adding seven new apps to Zapier, releasing a 150+ page ebook on email marketing and launching an education hub to show the best ways to use automation.Zapier is right at the cusp of 400 integrations, and growing rapidly.We’re excited to share them with you as soon as they are available for you to use, so make sure you’re subscribed to our app and product update blog.Is there an app you use with Zapier that you’d like to learn more about?Or possibly an app you’ve heard about and been wanting to try?</p>
