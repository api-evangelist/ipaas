<p>Lets paint a picture: youd like to offer up some sort of file for sale.It could be anything, say.an album of self-produced MP3s, a collection of quilting patterns, a video pack of kids tunes, an ebook on self-spiritual healing or even an Excel spreadsheet of horse racing odds!It doesnt matter, as long as it is a digital file.The idea is simple: when I receive a payment, send the user an email with a link to the file.</p>
