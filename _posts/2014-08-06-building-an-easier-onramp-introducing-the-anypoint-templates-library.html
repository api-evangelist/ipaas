<p>I am excited to announce the release of the next set of Anypoint Templates as well as a new way to find, access and utilize them.Made up of patterns (migration, broadcast, aggregation, bi-directional synchronization and correlation), objects (such as accounts or opportunities) and endpoints (Salesforce, SAP, Siebel, Database), templates address specific use cases and provide a launch pad for integration success.Anypoint Templates help you learn how to use MuleSoftâ€™s Anypoint Platform, leverage best practices and IP from MuleSoft, and ultimately, help you see success faster.Anypoint Templates are configurable, customizable, and extensible, making them both reusable and flexible.In April, we released a set of templates aimed at solving the challenge of integrating multiple instances, or orgs, of Salesforce.</p>
