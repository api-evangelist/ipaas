<p>If you’re a app developer or online merchant that uses Stripe to process your customers, you can now get some pretty nifty alerts thanks to a partnership between Stripe and If This Then That.For instance, every time you make a website sale, an IFTTT recipe could trigger an SMS message to your smartphone – or better yet, you could use rig a LittleBits speaker to play the sound of a ringing cash register.There is a more button-downed side to the partnership as well.IFTTT is tapping into Stripe’s notification and management systems and tying them to productivity and communications apps.Every transaction and new customer information could automatically be logged on Evernote or a Google spreadsheet.</p>
