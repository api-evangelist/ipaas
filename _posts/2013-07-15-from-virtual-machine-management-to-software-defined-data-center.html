<p>In its bid to own the software-defined data center category, we can expect to see VMware release VMware NSX — announced earlier this year — sometime in the next few months.The new product family combines technology from the company’s acquisition of Nicira last year with its current tools for virtual machine management.VMware is well known for its dominance of the virtualization marketplace, and its move into virtualized networking is its first serious foray outside of compute.Part of the challenge of building out a software defined data center is configuration of the network layer.It should properly reflect the relationships among a set of virtual machines that may be spun up on demand to handle system load.</p>
