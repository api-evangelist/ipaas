<p>This isnt hyperbole!Zapier enables anyone (Glass Explorers now included) to connect web services they use.With Zapiers Google Glass app, you can connect Glass to any of the other 200-plus services Zapier supports.This integration is the outcome of an invitation to the Glass Explorer program I received just two months ago.As my co-founders Bryan and Wade can attest, I wear it non-stop when I go out.</p>
