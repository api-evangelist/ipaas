<p>For the past few days, we’ve been investigating the OpenSSL vulnerability known as Heartbleed, looking for ways to remediate in a way that’s both safe and less onerous.Taking the most conservative approach, we believe the safest, most secure method remains regenerating your certificate authority and all OpenSSL certificates throughout your Puppet-managed infrastructure.We have made some small changes to the procedure to make it both safer and a little easier — safer in the sense that the process itself is more fail-safe.Visit the Puppet Labs Heartbleed Remediation Overview page for links to the most up-to-date remediation steps appropriate for your infrastructure and platform.We hope to have more for you in the next few days.</p>
