<p>We love Zapier.No, really – it’s awesome.At Rejoiner, we use 8-10 SaaS applications to run various aspects of our business.These applications power everything from customer support to subscription billing & payments.Though its fantastic to run an online business in a time where all of these tools are accessible to our growing company; we’ve found that it has been challenging to unify the data across each of the vendors we work with.</p>
