<p>Today we have a guest post from Digi International about programming Digi hardware with Temboo.You can find the original post on their blog:
The ongoing drought in the western United States underscores the importance of maintaining and conserving a reliable supply of fresh waterâ€”whether for drinking, irrigation, fire control, or manufacturing, reliable water storage is essential.Of course, half the battle in maintaining a water supply is managing it: once a tank system has been installed and filled, water must be properly distributed when it is needed and retained when it is not.If tanks are remote and many are spread over a wide area, monitoring them can become a costly and time-consuming obligation.These are the sorts of challenges that Digi and Temboo are overcoming by building a more intelligent Internet of Things.</p>
