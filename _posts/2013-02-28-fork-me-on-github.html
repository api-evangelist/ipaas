<p>We’ve just moved some of FoxWeave’s SaaS and Database connector implementations out to Github.FoxWeave Component Dev Wiki
 
We’re hoping the combination of some reference connector implementations + wiki based developer documentation will help people create an publish FoxWeave connectors to more and more Cloud and On-Premise Apps/APIs and Databases. Please let me know if you’re interested in building a connector for an App/DB, or know of someone that might be interested.Please share this news with your friends on Twitter … Tweet 
 We published two kinds of connector “modules”:
 Connectors for a number of Cloud Services (SaaS) – MailChimp, OnePageCRM and Zendesk.Connectors for a number of Relational Databases – Oracle, PostgreSQL and MySQL.</p>
