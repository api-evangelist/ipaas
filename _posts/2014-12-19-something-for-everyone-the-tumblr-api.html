<p>Today, we decided to write a blog post about blogging.Specifically, we wanted to take a look at the Tumblr API, a multifunctional social media API in our Library that (quite literally) tends to fade into the background in posts like this.Tumblrâ€™s API presents a wealth of opportunities for creative integration of text, images, videos, links, quotes, audio, and chat into applications, and our Choreos support all that functionality and more.To cover the breadth of what the Tumblr API can let you do, our API team built thirty-four Choreos and organized them into five bundles.Most processes having to do with the actual blog content are part of our Posts bundle, which covers creating, editing, deleting, retrieving, liking, and unliking posts.</p>
