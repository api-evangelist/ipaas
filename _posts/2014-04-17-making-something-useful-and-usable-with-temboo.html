<p>Making Something Useful and Usable with Temboo                             
Temboo can be a great tool for testing out your ideas without sinking too much creative effort into figuring out how to access the APIs you need, but it isn’t just a time saver for the development process—it’s also a toolbox full of different ways to build polished, functional apps.  Leon Barrett, the Head of Development at 383, did just that with his cloud-based temperature logger.  His idea—to collect and monitor temperature data with an Arduino Yún—is simple enough, but with a trick from the Temboo library, he was able to put an elegant finish on a useful project that we really enjoyed.Rather than trying to create something new and revolutionary, Leon chose to change his daily routine in a subtler way: his idea was to take a standard, mundane task and make it a bit easier.  He picked checking the thermostat, and made his goal to move the temperature display from a static wall fixture to his phone—that way, he could check the temperature in a room from anywhere, without ever having to get up from his seat.</p>
