<p>This week the Heartbleed security bug in the OpenSSL software library that is widely used across the web has made big news.We immediately took action.As of yesterday afternoon all of Temboo’s sites and internal systems have been updated, and our SSL keys and certificates changed accordingly to fix this bug. There is no evidence that any Temboo account information or data was compromised.However, since attacks exploiting this bug could be untraceable, we recommend updating your Temboo account, app, and credential information.</p>
