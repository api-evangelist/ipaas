<p>Salesforce offers two APIs to access and manipulate your cloud data – SOAP and REST, the latter called “Bulk API”.Although you can use both in CloverETL, you’d probably use CloverETL to manipulate large portions of data.Therefore, the Bulk API is more likely your preferred approach.To see why, let’s take a look at what Salesforce documentation has to say about Bulk API:
 “Bulk API is based on REST principles and is optimized for loading or deleting large sets of data.You can use it to query, insert, update, upsert, or delete a large number of records asynchronously by submitting batches which are processed in the background by Salesforce.</p>
