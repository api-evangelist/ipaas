<p>While I&rsquo;m wading through dictionaries and thesauruses in an effort to find a more appropriate term &ldquo;governance&rdquo;, when looking at SOA governance through the API lense--I figured I&rsquo;d flush out another area I&rsquo;m working to define a term that appropriately describes automation and interoperability using APIs.Yesterday I took a look at 31 backend as a service (BaaS) providers, in hopes of understanding more about what value they provide.Today Im diving into the automation section of my new API trends area.While reviewing, I noticed the exact same companies that were under automation were also in interoperability.So I set out to find a new word to apply to this next generation of ETL providers that are building bridges between cloud platforms using APIs, as well as legacy data connections.</p>
