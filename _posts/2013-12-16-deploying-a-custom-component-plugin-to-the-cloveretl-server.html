<p>A few weeks ago, we published a blog post about how to create a custom component.It described all of the necessary steps to implement your own component and how to integrate it into the CloverETL Designer.However, if you use the CloverETL Server and want to be able to use your component there, you need to go one step further.In this post, I’ll show you how to deploy the plugin into the Server so that your components also work in transformations living on the Server.For the purpose of this demonstration, I’m going to use the component we created in the previous blog post.</p>
