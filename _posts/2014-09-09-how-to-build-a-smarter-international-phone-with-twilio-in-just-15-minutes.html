<p>The phone app is one of the least smart parts of your phone.It’s still tied to one phone network, with a number from your local area, and likely costs per minute you talk, depending on where you’re calling and where you live.Travel outside your country, and your phone app will either cease to work or charge you an arm and a leg for roaming.Plenty of apps—from now-defunct services like Dialpad.com to modern standbys like Skype and Google Voice—have tried to change the way we make calls, but most still leave the original phone service untouched.</p>
