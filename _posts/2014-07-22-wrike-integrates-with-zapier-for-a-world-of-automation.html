<p>Or you could create a Zap wherein every new Google Calendar event automatically creates a task in Wrike, bypassing the need to go into Wrike and do it manually.Its all about convenience and saving time — which gets our thumbs up.   	
  		To create your own Zaps from scratch, simply designate Wrike as either the trigger or the action.But if youre starting out, it may be more convenient to make use of one of the many Zaps that other users have created, and use one as a template for creating your own custom Zap.    </p>
