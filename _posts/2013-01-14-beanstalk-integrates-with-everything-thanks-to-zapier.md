<p>Posted 						on January 14, 2013 						by  Chris Nagele 						 						 							 						 					Solid integration with many services has been at the core of Beanstalk since we started.Before we even launched out of beta over five years ago we had integration with Basecamp, Lighthouse and Fogbugz.Over the years we’ve continued to add and improve our integrations to help make your development process smooth and connected.Of course, keeping up with all of the integrations is hard work.Today Zapier, which is like a match maker for web services, announced support for Beanstalk, making it easier than ever to integrate Beanstalk with almost 200 services instantly.</p>
