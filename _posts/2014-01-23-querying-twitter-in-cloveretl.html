These days, social networks are pervasive.It’s virtually impossible to avoid some kind of interaction with at least a few of them.Not only that, but the mere fact that so many people use them means there’s a ton of interesting data available within.A typical example of such a popular network is Twitter, with more than 500 million tweets sent each day.Wouldn’t it be useful if you were able to automatically find tweets you want and then process them in bulk?</p>
