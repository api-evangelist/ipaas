<p>I just found an interesting brainstorm going on via Github, about how to make government more efficient and interoperable using APIs, that was created by government consultant Leah Bannon (@leahbannon), called If Gov Then That.The idea?Promote gov APIs by making them dead simple and suggesting clever recipes (like IFTTT and Zapier) Leah has started a rough list of some possible recipes, but needs your help to brainstorm what youd like to see for developing interoperability and automation recipes in our government.You can contribute via the Github project, on the conversation thread she started on the US Government APIs Google Group, and she will be working on as part of Code for DC.</p>
