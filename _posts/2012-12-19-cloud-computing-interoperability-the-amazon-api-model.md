{% include JB/setup %}<p>A recent discussion on CloudForum pertains to the nature of what interoperable cloud computing platform might be.Its been a real debate in the community for long time about what and inter operable cloud API actually looks like.From the market standpoint, its been my experience that there are two basic types of customers: customers building data-driven systems that require an API, and customers looking for easy-to-use tools in value-added services.Im sure there are others, and of course Im leaving out providers, and sticking specifically to the types of customers that Ive seen over the last year to year and a half in the cloud computing space, much of which has been around specific applications like Drupal, SOLR, etc.So you have a huge early adopter crowd on Amazons EC2, and while there is a huge variation, the high degree of technical complexity required to use it makes us a platform that is basically for the API crowd.</p>
