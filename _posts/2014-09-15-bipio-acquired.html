<p>bip.io (Billion Instructions Per I/O)  is a thin filtering, distribution and moderation layer for email aliases, social networks and other popular web services
Iâ€™m thrilled to announce BipIO was recently acquired by wot.io, a data service exchange for connected device platforms, and I have joined as the director of application engineering.Let me be the first to not only welcome you to the combined wot.io and BipIO ecosystem, but also explain how this acquisition benefits you.</p>
