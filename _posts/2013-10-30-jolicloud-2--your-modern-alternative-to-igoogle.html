<p>On November 1st, in just a few short days, iGoogle will be shutting down.The reason for this, according to Google, is that the product is not relevant to the present.“We originally launched iGoogle in 2005 before anyone could fully imagine the ways that today’s web and mobile apps would put personalized, real-time information at your fingertips.” (*)
 We believe you should not have to fear becoming homeless!Jolicloud 2 is here to welcome all users who are looking for an alternative, a more modern home that better suits today’s digital behaviours and landscapes.</p>
