<p>Today we have a guest post about our new PagerDuty Choreos from Vivian Au at PagerDuty; the post originally appeared on the PagerDuty Blog: 
Our customers are natural tinkers and builders, and we’re excited to launch our integration with Temboo.Many PagerDuty customers have found great success in using our solution to alert the right person and teams when issues occur in their systems and software.Some PagerDuty customers have been applying our alerting and on-call capabilities to other unique use cases such as creating an on-call rotation for roommate chores and sending alerts when trees are illegally cut down.Temboo offers a unique programming platform that normalizes access to 100+ APIs, databases, and code utilities to give developers the ability to connect to other applications without all the headache.APIs are powerful, but require maintenance 
Applications aren’t useful when they are siloed.</p>
