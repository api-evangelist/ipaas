<p>Musing on whether the DevOps ideas you’ve been reading about could be the way to a happier, more productive working life — but not sure how to make the case, or how you’ll demonstrate results?People using DevOps practices rely on several key performance indicators (KPIs) to judge the success of their DevOps efforts.Of the 4,000-odd people in 90-plus countries who responded to our 2013 State of DevOps survey, more than 63 percent “doing DevOps.” These respondents told us their most important measures of improvement are:
 Deployment frequency
 Speed of deployment
 Deployment success rate

 Culture, which actually can’t be measured.See below.</p>
