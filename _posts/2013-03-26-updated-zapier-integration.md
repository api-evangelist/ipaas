{% include JB/setup %}<p>We’ve improved our integration with Zapier to include many more triggers, another action, and support for custom fields.This allows you to extract more data from ActiveCampaign to push to other applications, as well as perform more actions (such as adding a subscriber or creating a campaign) using data pulled from other applications.You can now have Zapier capture the following events coming from ActiveCampaign:
 New Subscriber Created
 New Subscriber Update
 New Campaign Starts Sending
 New Campaign Open
 New Campaign Link Click
 New Campaign Share
 New Campaign Forward
 New Campaign Unsubscribe
 New Campaign Bounce
 New Campaign Reply
 
And you can have any other service perform the following actions in ActiveCampaign:
 Create Subscriber
 Create Campaign
 
We’ve also added support for custom fields so if you have ActiveCampaign set up as a trigger you will receive custom field data (for triggers that include a subscriber record) that can be mapped to your Zapier actions.Check out the help section article for more details!</p>
