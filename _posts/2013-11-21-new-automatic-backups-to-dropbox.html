<p>You know that sinking feeling you get when realizing you lost something you didn’t back up?That’s actually one of the reasons we started appFigures as a cloud platform.Our trusty servers provide redundant storage for your important data just in case you ever lose it.While this type of convenience has pretty much become an industry standard since the wild west days of the App Store, we decided to take it even further.We’re really excited to unveil our new automatic integration with Dropbox, available to all premium plan members.</p>
