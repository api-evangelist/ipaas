<p>Remember “Men Are from Mars, Women Are from Venus”, the best-selling hardcover nonfiction book published in the 90’s?It sounds to me as a good metaphor to highlight two key delivery models that are currently disrupting the software industry: cloud and open source.The cloud has profoundly changed the way business applications are consumed.From HR to customer relationship management and collaborative applications, it has become the delivery model of choice for the majority of new projects.It gave birth to new hyper growth companies, such as Salesforce in CRM, Workday in HR, Box and Dropbox in office automation and collaborative software.</p>
