<p>Pushwoosh is a free multi-platform push notification service, which enables developers, marketing reps and product owners to keep in touch with their app users, drive engagement, promote products, push up sales, and track the progress of the campaign with notifications.Providing almost instant access to the service, we take the load off developers who can focus on creating beautiful products, deploy them on multiple platforms and support push notifications to all these platforms at the same time.Lately we gave home to a few developers that migrated from Urban Airship prior to their Developer Edition shutdown that will take place on December 31, 2014.With our passion for automation, today we are introducing our Automatic Migration Tool that allows you to easily move all your subscribers to Pushwoosh.All you have to do is specify the app and API secret, and we will do the rest automatically!</p>
