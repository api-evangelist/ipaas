<p>As we move more of our personal and business lives into the clouds, we require more automation of tasks that keep our disparate worlds connected.</p>
<p>We don't just needs the individual silos we've put information into to be synced--we need the transfer or information and resources automated.</p>
<p>When a competitor updates their partner page, we need it saved in Evernote.  When our blog is updated we need it synced to Blogger or Tumblr.</p>
<p>API automation allows for the flow of information between the common platforms we depend on for our daily operations.  Many of these common platforms have RSS and APIs allowing a new breed of reciprocity platforms to emerge.</p>
<p>In this section i will be tracking news and companies that are doing interesting things around API automation and interoperability, while also sharing blog analysis I provide on reciprocity platforms and approaches.</p>
